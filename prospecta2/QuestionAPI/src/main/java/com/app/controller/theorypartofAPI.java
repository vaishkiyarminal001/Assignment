//	what are the key things you would consider when creating/consuming an API
//	to ensure that it is secure and reliable?
	
	
//	Answer-
//	
//	for creating and consuming:-
//	
//	1- I will implement the robust authentication and authorization mechanism and i will ensure that only user admin person can access the API.
//	2- I will always use the HTTPs to encrypt the data in transit and proctiting it from unnecessary attackers.
//	3- Most important thing that i will provide the clear information error message without eveling too much internal information.
//	4- I will keep myself updated about the security and releted to API which i consume.
//	5- Keep all the necessary liberaries and documentations uptodate.
